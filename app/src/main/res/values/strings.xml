Any User Content provided by you remains your property. However, by providing User Content to LearnHub, you grant LearnHub a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferrable, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to use, copy, modify, create derivative works of, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, and otherwise exploit in any manner such User Content in all formats and distribution channels now known or hereafter devised (including in connection with our Services and LearnHub\'s business and on third-party sites and services), without further notice to or consent from you, and without the requirement of payment to you or any other person or entity.
\n\nYou represent and warrant that: \n\n(i) you either are the sole and exclusive owner of all User Content or you have all rights, licenses, consents and releases necessary to grant LearnHub the license to the User Content as set forth above; and \n\n(ii) neither the User Content nor your submission, uploading, publishing or otherwise making available of such User Content nor LearnHub\'s use of the User Content as permitted herein will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party\'s intellectual property or proprietary rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.

\n\n\n4. Payment
\n\nYou understand that use of our Services may result in charges to you for the services or food and drinks you receive from LearnHub and/or a Third-Party Provider (“Charges”). After you have received services or food and drinks obtained through your use of our Service, LearnHub will facilitate your payment of the applicable Charges on behalf of the Third-Party Provider as such Third-Party Provider\'s limited payment collection agent. Payment of the Charges in such manner shall be considered the same as payment made directly by you to the Third-Party Provider. Charges may include other applicable fees, delivery fees, account maintenance fees, and/or surcharges including an order fee, cancellation fee, national, provincial and municipal surcharges and processing fees for split payments, and will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by LearnHub. You retain the right to request lower Charges from LearnHub or a Third-Party Provider for services or food and drinks received by you from LearnHub or such Third-Party Provider at the time you receive such services or food and drinks. LearnHub will respond accordingly to any request from a Third-Party Provider to modify the Charges for a particular service or food and drink.
\n\nAll Charges are due immediately and payment will be facilitated by LearnHub using the preferred payment method you opt for.
\n\nAs between you and LearnHub, LearnHub reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise Charges for any or all services or food and drinks obtained through the use of our Services at any time in LearnHub\'s sole discretion. Furthermore, you acknowledge and agree that Charges applicable in certain geographical areas may increase substantially during times of high demand. LearnHub will use reasonable efforts to inform you of Charges that may apply, provided that you will be responsible for Charges incurred under your Account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof. LearnHub may from time to time provide certain users with promotional offers and discounts that may result in different amounts charged for the same or similar services or food and drinks obtained through the use of the Services, and you agree that such promotional offers and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services or the Charges applied to you.
\n\nThis payment structure is intended to fully compensate LearnHub or the Third-Party Provider for the food or drinks services provided. It must be noted that LearnHub does not designate any portion of your payment as a tip or gratuity to the Third-Party Provider. Any representation by LearnHub (on LearnHub\'s website, in the Application, or in LearnHub\'s marketing materials) to the effect that tipping is “voluntary,” “not required,” and/or “included” in the payments you make for the food and drinks services provided is not intended to suggest that LearnHub provides any additional amounts, beyond those described above, to the Third-Party Provider. You understand and agree that, while you are free to provide additional payment as a gratuity to any Third-Party Provider who provides you with services or food or drinks obtained through the Service, you are under no obligation to do so. Gratuities are voluntary. After you have received services or food or drinks obtained through the Service, you will have the opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional feedback about your Third-Party Provider.

\n\n\n7. Governing Law; Arbitration.

Any dispute, conflict, claim or controversy arising out of or broadly in connection with or relating to the Services or these Terms, including those relating to its validity, its construction or its enforceability (any “Dispute”) shall be first mandatorily submitted to mediation proceedings under the International Chamber of Commerce Mediation Rules (“ICC Mediation Rules”). If such Dispute has not been settled within sixty (60) days after a request for mediation has been submitted under such ICC Mediation Rules, such Dispute can be referred to and shall be exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC Arbitration Rules”). The ICC Rules\' Emergency Arbitrator provisions are excluded. The Dispute shall be resolved by one (1) arbitrator to be appointed in accordance with the ICC Rules. The language of the mediation and/or arbitration shall be English, unless you do not speak English, in which case the mediation and/or arbitration shall be conducted in both English and your native language. The existence and content of the mediation and arbitration proceedings, including documents and briefs submitted by the parties, correspondence from and to the International Chamber of Commerce, correspondence from the mediator, and correspondence, orders and awards issued by the sole arbitrator, shall remain strictly confidential and shall not be disclosed to any third party without the express written consent from the other party unless: \n\n(i) the disclosure to the third party is reasonably required in the context of conducting the mediation or arbitration proceedings; and \n\n(ii) the third party agrees unconditionally in writing to be bound by the confidentiality obligation stipulated herein.

No joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship exists between you, LearnHub or any Third-Party Provider as a result of the contract between you and LearnHub or use of the Services.
